    - ACTUAL DEF: passing methods and properties from one class to another
    - IN JS: passing prototype from one constructor to another
        + illustrated in line 13 & 14
        + we want to use Object.create because had we done student.prototype = person.prototype, we're just referencing and 
          not creating a new object which would also make changes to our original Person constructor. As such, we use Object.create
          to create a new Object instead of just referencing it
        + After creating a new object for the new constructor, we have to reassign the object.
          If we check Student.prototype.constructor before reassignment, it would return the Person constructor. As such, we reassign
          the new object to its corresponding constructor as shown in line 14.
    
    
    1    function Person(name){
    2        this.name = name;
    3    }
    4    
    5    function Student(name){
    6        Person.apply(this, arguments);
    7    }
    8    
    9    Person.prototype.sayHi = function(){
    10        return "Hi " + name;
    11   }
    12    
    13   Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
    14   Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

    16   var micheal = new Student("Micheal");
    17   micheal.sayHi();
