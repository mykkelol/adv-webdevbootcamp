' keyword added to selector that specifies a special state of selected statement.
    - .class:hover, .class:active, .class:nth-of-type, etc.
    
' :focus, when item is clicked, tabbed on, or selected. usually an input field.
' :active, when item is activated by users. For example, when a button is clicked or clicked & hold.

' CSS transform
    - multiple transiforms within a class should be in one line (e.g. transform: scaleX(10px) translateY(5px);
    - let you move (translate), warp, rotate, and scale (alter size) elements
    - translateX(100px); move right 100px. 
        + translateY, translate(20px, 30px); move right 20 and down 30
    - scale(10); incrase by 10x
        + scaleX, scaleY, scale(x, y)
    - rotate(45deg); rotate(.9deg) 
    - transform-origin: 0 0; move the origin to top left
        + origin is set in the center of elements. So scale, for example, will alter size based on the middle of the element.
          By setting origin to 0 0, it will increase from top left of element instead of center.
        + transform-origin: left top; same as 0 0 
        
' CSS transition
    - allow us to control animation speed when manipulating CSS properties
    - transition-duration: 1s
        + how long the change should take or last
        + transition-duration: 1s, 2s; goes hand in hand with transition-property: background, border-radius;
    - transition-property: background-color; 
        + only transition background-color
        + specifies what property to transition
    - transition-delay: 5ms, 1s;
        + how long of a delay before the transition starts
    - transition-timing-function: ease-in; slow then fast speed
        + the speed of the transition
    - transition: background-color 1.5s ease-in 1;
        + property, duration, timing-function, delay
        + transition: transform 1.5s ease-in 1, background-color .05s linear;
        
' the only four transitions for optimal performance is: transform (translate, scale, rotate) and opacity
