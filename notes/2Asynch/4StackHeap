' stack
    - An ordered set of stack frames most recently invoked function is on the top of the stack.
    The bottom of the stack is the first function invoked. The stack is processed from top to bottom
    
    - Review following code:
    
    1  function multiply(x, y) {
    2    return x * y;
    3  }
    4
    5  var res = multiply(3,5);
    
    - Line 5 and 2 are invocations.
        + Line 2 is the most recent invoked function and so it's pushed to the top.
        + Line 5 is the first function invoked and so it's pushed to the bottom beanth Line 2.
        + After 3 * 5 is executed/popped off in Line 2, Line 5 gets a result to variable res and pops off.
