' asynchronous code
    - code which starts now but finishes at a later point in time
        + e.g. I raid with my WOW guild the same the time I ordered Dominos.
          Dominos will then deliver the pizza in 20mins, allowing me to raid and eat right after in exactly 20mins

' callback function
    - a function that is passed into another function as a parameter then invoked by the other function
    
    - review following code:
    
        function callback() {
            console.log("Coming from callback");
        }
        
        function highOrder(fn) {
            console.log("About to call callback fct");
            fn(); // b/c callback() is being called here indicate that callback() is a callback function.
            console.log("Callback has been invoked");
        }
        
        highOrder(callback);
        
    - used for: advanced array method, browser events (click, submits, DOM content loaded), AJAX requests, React Development
    - callbacks are typically used with annoymous functions like so:
        
        highOrder(function(inputs) {
            return inputs + blah;
        });
    
    
' high order function
    - a high order function is then... a function that accepts a callback function as a parameter
