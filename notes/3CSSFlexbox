' flexbox is a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space amont items in a container
    - starts with display: flex;
    
    - it has:
        + flex-items: items that are within the flex display (e.g. divs)
        + main-axis: direct where our flex display is assigned to
            ' flex-direction: row (default, left>right), row-reverse (right>left), column (top>bottom), column-reverse(bottom>top)
                - specifies how flex-items are placed in a flex display and defines the main/cross axis
        + cross-axis: opposite of main-axis
            ' cross-axis can be manipulated using flex-wrap: wrap-reverse
        
    - flex-wrap
        + specifies whether flex-items are forced into one line or multiple lines
        + inputs: wrap (forces to multiple line) or nowrap (default), wrap-reverse (change direction of cross axis)
    
' justify-content
    - specifies how space is distributed between items in a flex display along the main axis
    - inputs: flex-end (move all flex items to right), center (center all items), 
              space-between (spaces between elements), space-around (evenly distribute spaces around elements)
    
' align-items
    - opposite of justify-content in that it specifies how space is distributed along the cross axis
    - inputs: flex-start (place elements at start of cross-axis), flex-end (place elements at end of cross-axis), 
              stretch (to fit the flex display; default), center (align elements at center of cross-axis),
              baseline (align elements based on the baseline of our text; center of fonts)
    
' align-content
    - specifies how space is distributed between ROWS in flex container along the cross axis
    - only works if container contains rows of elements (e.g. wrapped elements)
    - inputs: flex-start (align at start of axis with remaining spaces at end of axis)
            , flex-end (opposite of flex-start), space-between (align rows at start and end of axis with space in-between)
            , space-around (align rows at start and end but has space all around including start and end of axis, 
            , center (align rows as a group in the center with spaces at start and end of axis)
