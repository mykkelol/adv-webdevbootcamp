' keyframes is more versatile than transition because it's a "multi-state animation"
    - in transitions, you go from A to B (change color of element from red to orange, for example)
    - in keyframes, you can go from A to B to C to D E (changing color of an element to various other states)
    - animation: sunmotion 3s 1s linear infinite;
    - animation: name duration delay timing-function iteration-count;
        + in the shorthand syntax, only the order of the duration and delay matters.
    
' animation-iteration-count
    - how many times the animation is repeated
    - inputs: any number or "infinite"
    
' animation-direction
    - animation set to go forward or back or both
    - inputs: forward, reverse, alternate, normal
    
' animation-fill-mode
    - specifies how animation applies styles before and after animation
    - in keyframes, we set the percentage of state. 
    - inputs: forward, backward, both
        + Forward will apply the last animation's style after animation
        + backward will apply the first animation's style before animation
        + Both will apply the first animation's style before and last animation's after animation
        
' animation-play-state
    - specifies whether the animation is running or paused.
    - inputs: paused, running
    - you can set original state as pause and change it to running when you hover, for example
