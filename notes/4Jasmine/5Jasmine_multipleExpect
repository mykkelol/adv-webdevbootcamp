' you can use multiple expects in a single "it" block, but it's not an effective practice
' instead, use multiple expects in a single "it" block when you are testing the same method

' see code below:
    
    describe("Planet Earth!", function(){
        
        it("is round", function(){
            expect(earth.isRound()).toBe(true);
        });
    
        it("has a method to check how far Earth is from the sun", function(){
            expect(earth.howFarFromSun).jasmine.any(Function);
            expect(earth.howFarFromSun()).toBe(3);
        });
    
    });
