- afterEach is written under beforeEach and runs after every "it" function. It is conceptually, a "teardown" of results because
  afterEach resets the data between test.
  
- see why it's useful below:

    describe("counting", fucntion(){
        var count = 0;
        
        beforeEach(function(){
            count++;
        });
        
        afterEach(function(){
            count = 0;
        });
    
        it("test if counter increases from var count = 0",function(){
            expect(count).toBe(1);
        });
        
        it("check if afterEach resets count to 0 and counts up again",function(){
            expect(count).toBe(1);
        });
    
    });
