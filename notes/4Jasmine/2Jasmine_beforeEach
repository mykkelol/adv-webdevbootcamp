- beforeEach is used to avoid repeating a declaration of a variable because it picks up a callback 
  before the 'it' function picks up its callback
- beforeAll/afterAll runs before ALL test, but it doesn't reset in between. So in example below,
  After pushing 7 in the first it, the array in second it will be 1,2,3,4,7,7. This is not used commonly
    
    - see code below:
        
        describe("Arrays", function(){
            var arr;
            beforeEach(function(){
                arr = [1,2,3];
            });
        
            it("add elements to an array", function(){
                arr.push(7);
                expect(arr).toEqual([1,2,3,7]);
            });
        
            it("returns new length of array", function(){
                expect(arr.push(7)).toBe(4);
            });
            
        });
