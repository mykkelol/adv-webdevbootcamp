' pending is used when we don't know what to expect of a result or when we don't want to run the test just yet
' pending can be used in three different syntax

' see code below:
    
    describe("penidng specs", function(){
    
        xit("can start with x for pending specs", function(){
            expect(true).toBe(true);
        });
        
        it("it can be a pending specs if there are no callback function");
        
        
        it("it can be a pending specs if pending() is clarified", function(){
            expect(2).toBe(2);
            pending();
        });
    });
