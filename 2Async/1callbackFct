Synchronus vs asynchronus
    - sync means everything is in synchornization, your code executes in order. Line 1 to 2 to 3 and so on.
    - async is the opposite of that where multiple things are happening at once without it being dependent on code prior to it.
    - an analogy for this would be making your own pizza (sync) vs ordering a pizza (async)

Callback function
    - a function that's passed into another function as a parameter then invoked by that other function.
    - e.g.
        function callback(){
            console.log("coming from callback");
        }
        
        function higherOrder(fn){
            console.log("about to call callback fn"); //1
            fn; //2 where callback is invoked
            console.log("callback has been invoked"); //3
        }
        
        higherOrder(callback);
    - console log would print 1, 2 (the call back console.log), and then 3.
    - callbacks are used in advanced array methods, browser events (clicks, submit, dom contents), AJAX requests, react dev
    
HigherOrder function
    - a function that accepts a callback as a parameter
    
forEach function
