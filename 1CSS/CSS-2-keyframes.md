    - keyframes are much more complex animation that are multi-state
        - e.g. transition/transform changes orange to red whereas keyframes changes 
            orange to yellow, light yellow, to light red and red
    
    - animation-iteration-count
        - how many time an animation should run (0 to infinity)
    - animation-direction
        - forward, reverse, or alternate (forward or backward vice versa)
        - forward would start at x=0 whereas reverse start at x=100
    - animation-fill-mode
        - how an animation apply styles before and after the animation
        - forwards, backawards, both, none
        - forward will maintain the animation at 100%, backward then would be 0
    - animation-play-state
        - animation running or paused
        - running, paused
        - e.g. when u hover, it pauses or when u hover, it runs
