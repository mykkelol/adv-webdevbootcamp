    AJAX 
        - asynchronus js and XML
        - is not a libray, not a framework, not a technology
        - is an approach and concept of building websites/apps
            - combination of utilizing HTML, CSS, JS, DOM, and XMLHTTP requests
    Ultimate definition of AJAX 
        - websites that can send and request data from a server in the background without disturbing the current page
            - led to Single Page Apps
            - think Google Maps when you scroll down and more of the map loads without refreshing or when you scroll down pinterest, it loads more items without refreshing
    The AJAX process
        - When users scroll down to the bottom, JS is making a request to the server to get more content and will append that new found data to the bottom of the page for users

/*
    JSON vs XML
        - XML was AJAX replaced by JSON
        - XML (extended markup lang) similar in syntax to HTML, but does not provide presentation like HTML does
        - JSON (JS Object Notation) looks almost like JS objects; looks cleaner IMO
            - obviously works more effectively with JS
            
        - so what we're really using today when we're saying AJAX is actually AJAJ
